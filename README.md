### Visualising shapes in the HTML

Each piece is currently rendered as a set of individual elements representing each square constituting the shape. These are placed on a CSS Grid.

This makes it trickier to do things with the shape as a whole such as adding an outline to the whole.

### Other options

-   SVG
-   Canvas
-   Images
